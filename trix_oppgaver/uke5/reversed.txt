There is no happy ending in real life
And I will never believe that
There is true love on earth
I would rather believe
Cinderella loves the prince just for his money
It is not true that
The world spins around love instead of money
In fact
Peter pan is a liar
I will shout to the world and object to the following line
‘Humans have a chance to fly’
Fantasy
Is only a hiding place from
Reality
I am sure that
Fairy tales are deceiving and disappointing
There is no way that
Dreams can come true
I shall never forget
Alice left me in the wonderland
Once upon a time
