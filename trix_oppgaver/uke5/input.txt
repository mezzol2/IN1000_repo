Once upon a time
Alice left me in the wonderland
I shall never forget
Dreams can come true
There is no way that
Fairy tales are deceiving and disappointing
I am sure that
Reality
Is only a hiding place from
Fantasy
‘Humans have a chance to fly’
I will shout to the world and object to the following line
Peter pan is a liar
In fact
The world spins around love instead of money
It is not true that
Cinderella loves the prince just for his money
I would rather believe
There is true love on earth
And I will never believe that
There is no happy ending in real life
