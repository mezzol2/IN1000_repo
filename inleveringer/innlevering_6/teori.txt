1.  Encapsulation is the idea that a main program only has access to certain public data from a subprogram, and that
    the details of the subprogram are private and completely hidden from the main program.  This is useful as it
    hides some complexity that the programmer does not need to think about all the time, and segments programs into
    more managable, "bite-sized" parts.

2.  The public interface of a class in Python are the methods and values of that class.  These methods and values can
    be called in the main program as they are public.  The implementation of a class is the building and defining of
    the class's methods and values, and this data is private and hidden from the main program.

3.  Instance methods are tied to specific user-defined classes and can only be called in reference to an instance of
    that class.  The functions we have used previously were more general and not tied to a specific class.
